# Sparse Priming Representations (SPR)

Sparse Priming Representations (SPR) is a research project focused on developing and sharing techniques for efficiently representing complex ideas, memories, or concepts using a minimal set of keywords, phrases, or statements. This enables language models or subject matter experts to quickly reconstruct the original idea with minimal context. SPR aims to mimic the natural human process of recalling and recombining sparse memory representations, thus facilitating efficient knowledge storage and retrieval.

## Overview

This repository contains the following:

1. Research: Documentation of experiments, findings, and insights related to Sparse Priming Representations, including research papers, notes, and summaries.
2. Examples: A collection of example SPRs for various domains, showcasing how different complex ideas can be distilled into concise, easy-to-understand primers.
3. Tools: Scripts, libraries, or tools developed during the research process to help create or evaluate Sparse Priming Representations.
4. Tutorials: Step-by-step guides on how to create and use Sparse Priming Representations effectively in various contexts, such as AI systems, knowledge management, or learning.
5. Contributions: Contributions from the community in the form of new SPR examples, research, or tools are welcome. Guidelines on how to contribute can be found in the CONTRIBUTING.md file.
